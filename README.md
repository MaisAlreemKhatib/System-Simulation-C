This project is a Space Simulation developed in C language as part of a programming course. It models a simplified space environment including planets, spacecrafts, people, and the flow of time.

Planets are categorized into different types such as rocky planets, gas giants, ice giants, and dwarf planets.

A spacecraft can interact with planets and characters within the simulation.

People (Kisi) are represented as objects that participate in the simulation.

Time management is implemented through dedicated classes (Zaman, OrtakZaman).

The simulation initializes its data (planets, vehicles, people) from external files (Gezegenler.txt, Araclar.txt, Kisiler.txt).

The main control flow is managed by Simulasyon.c, which ties together planets, vehicles, and time to run the simulation.

Key Features:

Fully written in C language

Structured with modular source and header files

Uses file I/O to load external data

Demonstrates object-oriented design principles in C (through modularity and abstractions)

Provides a compiled executable (simulasyon.exe) to run the program
